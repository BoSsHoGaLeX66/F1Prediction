On behalf of Searle Data Consultants, we would like to thank you for allowing us to work with your team, and wish you 
the best of luck this season. In the highly competitive atmosphere of Formula 1 where every tenth counts and can make or 
break a race it is crucial to have every insight and edge possible over the competition. One of these crucial details is the ability to accurately predict race outcomes, especially those who finish in the top 3. Being able to predict the top 3 allows you to know who the main competitors are for the next race allowing for better race strategy and preparation.

Given the provided data, we have been able to create multiple new features that are useful in predicting race outcomes and created many different models that can predict the top 3 drivers for a given race. Based upon our analysis, we found that many different machine learning models can make accurate predictions of who will finish on the podium and the best from our findings is a random forest classifier.

## **Data: Summary and General Data Preparation** 
In the provided data set there were 26080 race results, 21 fields for each race result, there were 12 numerical fields and 9 categorical fields. There were no missing data points in the original data set.
