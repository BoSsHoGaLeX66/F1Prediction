    "- The features include, driver_avg_finish_pos_season, top3_driver_season_percentage, driver_avg_finish_pos_season_lag, top3_driver_season_percentage_lag, Constructor_Top3_Percent, and grid, among others which will be explored in detail."

    "- grid exhibits a left skewed distribution with spikes at certain values, might need to play with value more but should be fine for now. Also exhibits a strong correlation with the target variable\n",
    "- driver_avg_finish_pos_season exhibits a normal distribution and shows correlation with the finishing in the top 3.\n",
    "- top3_driver_season_percentage exhibits a mostly uniform distribution but with a spike at zero which makes sense because most drivers won't finish in the top 3 in a given season. Also displays a correlation with finishing in the top 3.\n",
    "- Constructor_Top3_Percent exhibits a left skewed distribution with a spike at 0 which makes sense because most teams don't have a car in the top 3 in a given season. Also displays a correlation with finishing in the top 3.\n",
    "- driver_avg_finish_pos_season_lag exhibits all the same features as driver_avg_finishing_pos_season because it is the same data just pushed forward a year.\n",
    "- top3_driver_season_percentage_lag exhibits all the same features as top3_driver_season_percentage_lag because it is the same data just pushed forward a year.\n",

    "### 2. Modeling\n",
    "- The best models to use on this data for the given features is Decision Trees and Random Forest because the features distributions vary greatly for if they are in the top 3 or not and these model work well when this is the case.\n",
    "- Split the data into a test and training set based on year to prevent data leakage, then used grid search to cross validate the model while finding the best parameters\n",
    "- Best model found was a Decision Tree with an AUC score of 0.85 and .71 on the train and test sets respectively. What this means is that the model does an ok job at discriminating between drivers who will and who won't be in the top 3 for a certain race and that there isn't a high trade off between true positive rate and false positive rate. The large difference between the training and test scores also indicates that the model is overfit even after hyper tuning meaning that there is probably a problem with the data which can be address in another iteration of this exploration.\n",
    "- This model is easily explainable because it is just a series of if else statements so it will be easy to explain to clients exactly how the answers are found. This model is also easily scalable in a production environment because evaluating if else statements takes very little computational power also meaning that it could be deployed on a small computer trackside if need be \n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "There are multiple features that can be good discriminators for the target feature as their distributions vary for the top 3 and not top 3 classes of the target feature and we already used them to build a decent model. This however revealed that there are some flaws in the data as we had an over fit model even after hyper tuning but this is useful information and shows that in the next iteration of this project we will have to revisit some processes and improve them to try and get a better model."
